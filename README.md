- Hello GitHub, and hello user.

- Online, I go by Aviixx. I am a Batch developer. I wouldn't call myself a professional by any means, but I do know what I'm doing.
> I work on a program called MuProgram. There is no website (yet), but I want to continue development on this program as much as possible. MuProgram is an open sourced Batch file that lets users do that they want to do.
  I myself am unsure when this program will be fully finished, especially with security needs increasing and constant bugs that arise. I would love to work with others to finish this program and make the code look 'neat'.

> The only languages I really know are HTML, CSS and Batch. With IRL languages, I speak English, Dutch and a little Russian, for anyone wondering.


Nice to meet you all. If you are interested in learning my ways of coding, please check my repositories.
